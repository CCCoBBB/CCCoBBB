## Hello! 
## My name is Cob
-------------

- I've just wrapped up a 15-week Full Stack Web Development course at DevAcademy Aotearoa, and it was an incredible journey that further ignited my passion for software development. During this program, we delved into a range of technologies like React, Node.js, Express Router, and Tailwind.
  
* I am currently working on a video calling web application using webRTC and websockets.
* I am also working on my portfolio which will be up and running very soon!
  
+ For my final group project at DevAcademy, I worked on Clicky, a browser game which allows you to train your cursor accuracy skills, good for people who play video games. While working on this project, my primary focus was on testing backend routes and frontend components as well as creating front end components.
